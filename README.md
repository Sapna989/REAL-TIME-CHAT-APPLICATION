**REAL-TIME CHAT-APPLICATION**

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: SAPNA SIKARWAR

INTERN ID: CT06DG915

DOMAIN NAME: FRONT-END WEB DEVELOPMENT

This Real-Time Chat Application is a dynamic web-based messaging platform built using WebSockets and a modern front-end framework like React.js. It enables users to send and receive messages instantly without refreshing the page, creating a smooth and interactive chat experience. The core functionality relies on WebSockets, allowing real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server. This project is ideal for learning the fundamentals of real-time communication and front-end development using modern tools.

The application features a clean, responsive user interface that adapts well to desktops, tablets, and smartphones. It supports real-time text messaging, user connection and disconnection notifications, and optional features like typing indicators and time stamps. The design is kept simple and user-friendly, focusing on seamless interaction and ease of use. This makes it suitable for integration into more complex projects like customer support systems, collaborative apps, or chat-based services.

To get started with the project, first clone the repository to your local machine. Open the project folder in your terminal and run npm install to install all necessary dependencies. Once installation is complete, start the development server by running npm start or vite depending on the setup. If your app is connected to a WebSocket server (e.g., using Socket.IO and Node.js), ensure that the server is also running in parallel. You can now open the application in your browser and begin chatting in real time. This project serves as a hands-on example of real-time web app development and communication using modern technologies.
